Forique: Strategic Blueprint, Product Architecture & Implementation Guide
1. Executive Strategic Vision
The digital commerce landscape for artificial and imitation jewelry is currently navigating a period of significant structural friction. While global demand for affordable, trend-driven accessories is projected to reach $27.85 billion by 2030, the market remains fragmented, characterized by inconsistent quality standards, redundant supply chains, and a deficit of consumer trust.1 Forique is conceived not merely as a transactional marketplace but as a trust-brokering infrastructure designed to resolve these endemic inefficiencies through a Hybrid Catalog Model and an Agentic Development Architecture.
This report articulates the comprehensive business, product, and technical strategy for Forique. It posits that the traditional binary choice between "managed inventory" (high control, low scale) and "open marketplace" (low control, high scale) is insufficient for the jewelry vertical. Instead, Forique adopts a Centralized Product Master architecture for generic goods—leveraging the "Latch-on" mechanic popularized by Amazon and Flipkart—while simultaneously maintaining protected Brand Storefronts for artisanal creators.2 This dual approach maximizes liquidity for unbranded commodities while preserving brand equity for designers, directly addressing the legal and operational challenges highlighted in recent e-commerce jurisprudence regarding "passing off" and trademark infringement.4
Furthermore, Forique distinguishes itself through its engineering methodology. By adopting Google Antigravity—an agent-first Integrated Development Environment (IDE)—the platform's development lifecycle is compressed. The engineering team transitions from writing imperative code to orchestrating autonomous AI agents via structured contexts like AGENTS.md. This shift allows for rapid iteration of complex features such as Visual Search deduplication and Real-time RTO (Return to Origin) prediction, fundamentally altering the economics of platform maintenance and feature velocity.5
The following sections detail the strategic business model, granular functional requirements, and the technical blueprint required to execute this vision. The analysis integrates data on average order values (AOV), commission structures, and quality assurance benchmarks to construct a robust, scalable, and defensible platform ecosystem.

2. Strategic Business Model & Market Architecture
2.1 The Friction of Fragmentation: Market Analysis
The imitation jewelry sector operates with distinct economic characteristics that differentiate it from fine jewelry and general fashion. The primary driver of consumption is "high-frequency, low-stakes" purchasing behavior, where the Average Order Value (AOV) in markets like India typically ranges between ₹800 and ₹1,200 ($10-$15).8 This low AOV imposes strict constraints on customer acquisition costs (CAC) and logistics expenses.
A critical analysis of the current market reveals three primary friction points:
1. Catalog Redundancy: A single generic design (e.g., "Gold-plated Jhumka") is often listed by hundreds of sellers as unique items, creating search pollution and decision paralysis for the consumer.10
2. Trust Deficit: Consumers struggle to differentiate between high-quality plating (e.g., 1-micron gold plating) and inferior "flash plating" based solely on digital images. This leads to high return rates, which erode the thin margins inherent to the category.11
3. Supply Chain Opacity: Unbranded goods, which constitute a significant portion of the market, often lack standardized identifiers (UPC/EAN), making inventory tracking and anti-counterfeiting measures difficult.13
Forique addresses these by positioning itself as a Managed Marketplace. Unlike open bazaars (eBay, Etsy) where every listing is unique, or pure retailers (Zara) that own inventory, Forique acts as the central arbiter of product data. It owns the "Product Master" record for generic goods, enforcing a "Single Source of Truth" that sellers must adhere to, thereby commoditizing the supply while elevating the customer experience through standardized attributes and quality guarantees.14
2.2 The Hybrid Inventory Strategy
The strategic linchpin of Forique is the Hybrid Inventory Model. This model acknowledges that the jewelry market is bifurcated into "Commodity Styles" (trends that are mass-manufactured) and "Creator Designs" (unique, IP-protected pieces). Attempting to treat these two categories with a single logic is a primary cause of failure for vertical marketplaces.
2.2.1 The "Latch-On" Track (Commodity Liquidity)
For unbranded or white-label goods, Forique utilizes a centralized catalog system similar to Amazon's ASIN or Flipkart's FSN structure.3
* Mechanism: When a seller attempts to list a generic product (e.g., "Plain Gold Hoop"), the system utilizes AI-driven Visual Search algorithms to detect if the product already exists in the master database.17
* Action: If a match is found, the seller is prompted to "Latch On" to the existing listing rather than creating a duplicate. They simply input their price and stock level.
* Benefit: This aggregates liquidity. Instead of 50 separate pages for the same hoop earring, there is one page with 50 sellers competing for the "Buy Box." This competition drives down prices for consumers and ensures that the best-performing sellers (based on speed, rating, and price) capture the volume.19
* Risk Mitigation: To prevent the "counterfeit variance" problem—where a seller latches on with an inferior version of the product—Forique implements a "Test Buy" protocol and strict attribute mapping (e.g., mandating base metal disclosure).12
2.2.2 The "Brand Gating" Track (IP Protection)
For designers and established brands, the "Latch-On" model poses a threat to brand equity. Therefore, Forique implements a rigorous Brand Gating architecture.
* Mechanism: Sellers with registered trademarks undergo a "Brand Registry" process during onboarding. This grants them exclusive control over their product detail pages (PDPs).4
* Protection: The system systematically blocks unauthorized sellers from latching onto these gated ASINs. Unauthorized attempts trigger a "Request Approval" workflow, where the brand owner can grant or deny distribution rights.
* Legal Context: This structure is essential to comply with evolving e-commerce jurisprudence, such as the Delhi High Court's rulings on "passing off," which mandate that platforms must prevent third-party sellers from riding on the goodwill of established brands.3
2.3 Business Model Canvas & Monetization
Forique’s revenue architecture is designed to capture value at multiple stages of the commerce lifecycle, leveraging the high-volume nature of the category.


Revenue Stream
	Mechanism & Strategy
	Market Benchmark Context
	Transaction Commission
	A percentage fee on the Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) of every sale. The rate is dynamic: 5-10% for high-value semi-precious items to encourage supply, and 15-22% for fashion jewelry where platform discovery adds significant value.
	Aligns with industry standards (Amazon India ~22% for fashion jewelry, Flipkart ~4-20%).23
	Logistics & Fulfillment
	"Forique Fulfilled" charges for storage, picking, packing, and last-mile delivery. This is not just a revenue center but a strategic lever to control the customer experience and reduce RTO.
	Essential for mitigating the high RTO rates (15-20%) prevalent in Indian e-commerce.25
	Advertising (Sponsored Products)
	A bidding model for "Sponsored" placement in search results and category pages. This allows new sellers to "buy" visibility in the Buy Box rotation.
	Highly effective in catalog-based models where organic visibility is competitive.27
	SaaS & Data Services
	Premium subscriptions for sellers offering advanced analytics: "Trend Spotting" reports (e.g., "Oxidized Silver demand up 40% in Bangalore") and automated repricing tools.
	Monetizes the data exhaust generated by the platform.28
	2.4 Competitive Differentiation Strategy
While generalist marketplaces (Amazon, Flipkart) rely on sheer volume, Forique differentiates through Vertical Depth.
* Attribute Richness: Unlike generic platforms that treat jewelry as "Apparel," Forique’s database schema enforces jewelry-specific attributes: Plating Thickness (Microns), Base Metal (Brass vs. Alloy), and Stone Type (Polki vs. Kundan).12 This granularity powers precise filtering (e.g., "Show only Hypoallergenic / Nickel-Free").
* Trust Architecture: The platform integrates a "Quality Assurance (QA) Intermediary" model for high-value items. Products sold above a certain price threshold are routed through a Forique QA hub for verification before reaching the customer, effectively eliminating the risk of counterfeits for premium goods.31
________________
3. Comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD)
The Product Requirements Document (PRD) translates the strategic vision into concrete functional specifications. The platform is divided into three primary interfaces: the Customer App, the Brand (Seller) Panel, and the Admin (Operations) Panel.
3.1 Module 1: The Centralized Catalog & Taxonomy Engine
Strategic Goal: Eliminate redundancy and enforce data quality.
The heart of Forique is the Catalog Management System. Unlike traditional systems that allow free-text entry, this module enforces a strict taxonomy.
* Category Hierarchy: The system utilizes a deep, nested hierarchy (e.g., Jewelry > Earrings > Jhumkas > Oxidized Silver) to drive discovery.
* Attribute Enforcement: Each leaf node in the category tree inherits specific mandatory attributes.
   * Example: A product listed under "Gold Plated Chains" must define the "Base Metal" and "Plating Method" attributes. Failure to provide structured data results in rejection.30
* Deduplication Logic: When a seller uploads an image, the system generates a vector embedding using a CLIP-based model.34 It queries the vector database (e.g., Pinecone/Milvus) for similarity.
   * Scenario A (High Similarity > 95%): The system infers a match and prompts the seller to "Latch On" to the existing Product Master.
   * Scenario B (Low Similarity): The system allows the creation of a new Product Master, subject to AI-assisted moderation to verify uniqueness.10
3.2 Module 2: The "Latch-On" and Buy Box Algorithm
Strategic Goal: Optimize liquidity and price competitiveness.
This module governs how multiple sellers compete for a single product listing.
* Seller Mapping: Sellers map their inventory to a unique Forique ID (FQID). This mapping process handles variants (e.g., size, color) to ensure that a "Red" variant isn't treated as a completely different product from a "Blue" one.20
* Buy Box Logic: The algorithm determines which seller's offer is added to the cart when a user clicks "Buy Now." The scoring logic is a weighted function of:
   1. Landed Price (40%): Product price + Shipping cost.
   2. Fulfillment Speed (30%): Priority given to "Forique Fulfilled" inventory located closest to the buyer.
   3. Seller Health (20%): Derived from Cancellation Rate, Return Rate, and Customer Ratings.19
   4. Stock Consistency (10%): Historical ability to maintain inventory levels without stockouts.19
3.3 Module 3: Visual Search & Discovery Experience
Strategic Goal: Reduce search friction in a highly visual category.
Jewelry shopping is often driven by visual inspiration rather than keyword intent.
* Visual Search Engine: Users can upload a screenshot (e.g., from Instagram/Pinterest). The system identifies the jewelry within the image, segments it (separating earrings from necklaces), and queries the catalog for the nearest visual matches.17
* "Complete the Look": Utilizing collaborative filtering and visual similarity, the PDP suggests matching items. If a user views a Kundan necklace, the system suggests matching Kundan earrings and Maang Tikkas, effectively increasing the Average Order Value (AOV) through bundling.38
* Trust Badges: Dynamic badges are injected into the product card based on verified attributes: "Certified Plating," "Hypoallergenic," and "Verified Seller".2
3.4 Module 4: Order Management & Logistics (RTO Mitigation)
Strategic Goal: Protect margins by minimizing return logistics costs.
Return to Origin (RTO) is the single largest profit leak in Indian e-commerce. This module aggressively manages this risk.
* Address Intelligence: The system scores delivery addresses based on historical data. Addresses with a history of RTO or incomplete data (e.g., missing landmark) trigger a verification workflow.2
* COD Verification: For Cash-on-Delivery orders, an automated IVR call or WhatsApp bot confirms the customer's intent to purchase before the order is dispatched.
* Dispute Resolution Workflow: To handle the "Box Empty" or "Wrong Product" fraud, the system enforces a strict evidence-based claim process. Customers must upload unboxing videos or images within 48 hours of delivery to raise a dispute. The Admin panel provides tools for "Manual Overrides" and "Refund Wallet" credits to resolve legitimate issues quickly.2
3.5 Module 5: Quality Assurance & Compliance
Strategic Goal: Build long-term trust and brand equity.
* Brand Onboarding: A rigorous KYC (Know Your Customer) process collects GSTIN, PAN, and Cancelled Cheques. For "Brand Gating," sellers must upload Trademark Certificates.2
* Physical QA Checklists: For "Forique Fulfilled" items, warehouse staff utilize specific checklists:
   * Visual: Check for scratches, dents, or asymmetry.
   * Functional: Test clasp tension, earring post strength, and stone setting security.21
   * Material: Random batch testing for nickel content (hypoallergenic compliance) and plating thickness verification.12

4. Technical Architecture & Agentic Development Strategy
Forique’s engineering strategy is defined by the adoption of Google Antigravity, an agentic IDE that fundamentally shifts the developer's role from "writer" to "orchestrator." This section details the technical blueprint required to support the business model while leveraging AI to accelerate delivery.
4.1 The "Antigravity" Agentic Workflow
Reference: Google Antigravity Architecture 5
Traditional development involves manually writing boilerplate code. In the Antigravity paradigm, developers define the intent and constraints via artifacts, and autonomous agents execute the implementation.
The "Mission Control" Interface:
Developers interact with a dashboard that manages multiple agents. Instead of editing files directly, they issue high-level directives (e.g., "Refactor the Auth module to support OTP"). The agents generate Implementation Plans and Task Lists which the developer reviews before execution. This "Verify with Artifacts" model builds trust in the AI's output.6
The AGENTS.md Context Protocol:
To ensure agents understand the specific architectural constraints of Forique, the project root contains a rigorously maintained AGENTS.md file. This file acts as the "Constitution" for the AI agents.42
Example AGENTS.md Structure for Forique:
AGENTS.md - Forique Platform Context
1. Project Identity & Persona
You are a Senior Full-Stack Architect building 'Forique', a scalable B2C jewelry marketplace.
Your code must be production-ready, type-safe, and optimized for high-concurrency e-commerce workloads.
2. Technology Stack Constraints
* Frontend: Next.js 16 (App Router), React Server Components (RSC) by default.
* Styling: Tailwind CSS with Shadcn/UI. No custom CSS files unless necessary.
* Backend: Node.js (NestJS) microservices or Serverless Functions via Next.js.
* Database: PostgreSQL (Supabase). Use Prisma ORM.
* Vector DB: Pinecone for visual search embeddings.
3. Architecture Rules
* Schema First: Always reference docs/SCHEMA.md before writing database queries.
* Latch-On Logic: Never create a new Product Master without first checking for duplicates via the Visual Search API.
* Security: All vendor data (KYC documents) must be stored in encrypted S3 buckets with signed URLs.
4. Operational Boundaries
* ✅ Always: Write unit tests (Jest) for every new utility function.
* ⚠️ Ask First: Before modifying the database schema or adding new npm dependencies.
* 🚫 Never: Hardcode API keys or secrets. Use .env.local.
4.2 Application Stack & Data Schema
Reference: Tech Stack for 2025 45, Database Schema 7
Frontend (Next.js 16):
The App Router architecture allows for granular caching and streaming, essential for loading media-heavy jewelry catalogs quickly. Server Components reduce the client-side JavaScript bundle, improving Core Web Vitals (LCP/INP) which are critical for SEO and mobile conversion.46
Database Design (PostgreSQL):
The schema must support the "One Master, Many Offers" logic.
Entity
	Description
	Key Fields
	product_masters
	The "Single Source of Truth" for a product.
	id (UUID), title, attributes (JSONB), vector_embedding (Array), brand_id (FK)
	product_variants
	Specific variations (e.g., Gold vs. Silver).
	id, master_id (FK), sku, color, material, images (Array)
	seller_offers
	The actual inventory listing from a seller.
	id, variant_id (FK), seller_id (FK), price, stock, fulfillment_type, is_buy_box_winner
	orders
	Transactional records.
	id, user_id, status (Enum), payment_status, rto_risk_score
	4.3 Visual Search Pipeline
Reference: Visual Search API 18
1. Ingestion: When a product image is uploaded via the Brand Panel, a background job (managed by Temporal.io) triggers the ingestion pipeline.
2. Vectorization: The image is passed to a pre-trained CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) model. This model converts the visual features (shape, color, texture) into a high-dimensional vector (e.g., 512 dimensions).
3. Indexing: This vector is stored in Pinecone or Milvus, indexed for fast Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search.
4. Querying: When a user uploads a photo, it is vectorized using the same model. The system queries the Vector DB for the nearest neighbors (cosine similarity).
5. Re-ranking: The raw visual matches are re-ranked based on business logic: Availability, Seller Rating, and Price. This ensures users don't just see "visually similar" items, but items they can actually buy from trusted sellers.34
________________
5. UX Flows & Design Strategy
The User Experience (UX) of Forique focuses on reducing cognitive load and building trust through transparency. The design philosophy draws from the "Antigravity" concept—making complex interactions feel weightless and seamless.
5.1 UX Flow: Seller "Latch-On" Listing
Objective: Allow a seller to list a generic product in under 30 seconds.
1. Initiation: Seller logs into the Brand Panel and clicks "Add Product."
2. Identification: Seller uploads a product image or scans a barcode (if available).
3. Visual Match Analysis: The system displays a "Scanning..." animation while querying the Vector DB.
4. Result Presentation:
   * Match Found: The system displays the existing Product Master. "We found this product in our catalog. Sell yours here?"
   * Context: It displays the current "Buy Box Price" (e.g., ₹499) and the "Lowest Offer" to guide pricing strategy.
5. Configuration: Seller enters their specific details: Price, Stock Quantity, and SKU.
6. Confirmation: Seller clicks "List Item." The offer is instantly live, competing for the Buy Box.
5.2 UX Flow: Consumer Visual Discovery
1. Trigger: User taps the "Camera" icon in the search bar.
2. Capture/Upload: User takes a photo of a jewelry piece or selects a screenshot from their gallery.
3. Crop & Focus: A UI overlay allows the user to crop the image to focus on the specific item (e.g., isolating earrings from a full-body portrait).
4. Results Grid: The app displays a grid of visually similar products.
   * Tags: Results are auto-tagged with attributes like "Gold Plated," "Kundan," or "Under ₹500" to allow further refinement.
5. Conversion: User clicks a result to view the PDP, where "Complete the Look" suggestions encourage cross-selling.
5.3 UX Flow: Brand Gating & Protection
Objective: Prevent unauthorized selling of IP-protected goods.
1. Attempt: A reseller attempts to "Latch On" to a product identified as belonging to a verified brand (e.g., "Voylla").
2. Interception: The system detects the brand_id association on the Product Master.
3. Restriction: A modal appears: "Restricted Product. This item belongs to a registered brand. You need authorization to sell this product."
4. Resolution:
   * Option A: "Request Approval" - Triggers a workflow sending a request to the Brand Owner.
   * Option B: "This is a different product" - Seller is redirected to the "Create New Product" flow, where they must provide unique identifiers and images to prove it is not a counterfeit.
